# Full-stack Engineer Challenge

The challenge consists of two parts:

- [Code Challenge](./CodeChallenge.md)
- [Written Challenge](./WrittenChallenge.md)

You can fork this repo to submit your work.

The challenges are designed to demonstrate the applicant's way of thinking and personal passions. All challenges are open ended, so please feel free to frame the questions as you see fit, or answer them in any way that you think interesting and revealing.

Enjoy and good luck!
