## Section 1: Architectural Design

_Please answer at lease one of the following questions._

- Assume that you are building a discussion forum similar with [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The product will be very popular, and your team made the following projection: monthly traffic of 30k page views and 5k posts in the first year, and monthly traffic of 300m page views and 500k posts in the second year. How would you choose your frontend and backend technologies, infrastructures and deploying methods? What methods will you use in scaling your platform and evolving the infrastructures?

- Assume that you are building a backend service for a medical company. When a request come in, this service needs to take the user input, pass it to a pre-trained computational model, and return the output to the user. The service needs to handle a high request frequency with uncertain average traffic volume, and the computational model needs to process large amount of data in parallel. How would you design this service and choose the building blocks to achieve the above requirements?

- Assume that you have an application that is growing very fast. It uses PostgreSQL as data storage, and the growing traffic is making write and read operations slow. What strategies would you take to scale your database horizontally and vertically?

## Section 2: Distributed Systems and Web3

What technologies and product would be the essential building blocks, what roles would they play, and how would you combine them together?

- Assume you are to design a product for crowdfunding creative projects with NFTs, where the creator pre-sale the ownership of the final result as NFTs. From minting the tokens to delivering the final result, what are the UX and technological challenges you forsee, and what do you think it takes to solve these problems well?
